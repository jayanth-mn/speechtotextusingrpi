I have used Rpi 3B+ Model
Make sure to install the following packages on rpi before executing the code:

pyaudio
speechtotext recognition
vosk

python 3.0 version

Once all this is installed, you need to buy a USB type microphone which is available for around 250-300 INR in the market.
After connecting it, you'll be able to run the code without any error.
Saving of the output doesn't happen if you use Thonny on Rpi, for that run the program directly on terminal after entire code is saved on thonny software.
Once you run it on the terminal, it will be able to take input from user even in terminal
and the output also gets stored in a new txt file
which will be saved on desktop
